          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
            Hello! I’m NeNo, a passionate frontend developer with skills in
            HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React. I enjoy crafting user-friendly and
            responsive web experiences.
          </p>

          <h4>Education</h4>
          <p>
            I have completed studies in Front-End Development at NOROFF School
            of Technology and Digital Media, Caregiver Education at Lifeline
            International Health Institute, and Bachelor studies in Secondary
            Education at Southern Iloilo Polytechnic College.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-3">
            Throughout my Front-End Development journey at Noroff School of
            Technology and Digital Media, I've gained proficiency in various
            technologies and tools.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-3">
            I bring a solid educational foundation and a dedication to staying
            current with industry trends. I am eager to contribute my skills and
            a fresh perspective to a team that values innovation and excellence.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-3">
            Beyond my formal education, I actively engage in continuous learning
            by participating in various online coding camps. It's not just about
            Codefinity, FreeCode Camp but other similar training; I seek
            opportunities from a multitude of platforms to fill up any knowledge
            gaps. This dedication reflects my commitment to staying at the
            forefront of industry trends and technologies, addressing not just
            what I know but also identifying and filling any lacking knowledge.
            Proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I approach challenges with
            enthusiasm and a problem-solving mindset. My journey is not limited
            to what I've learned so far; instead, I am driven to explore and
            master advanced coding languages. Eager to contribute my diverse
            skill set to a dynamic team, I am actively seeking an environment
            that values adaptability and continuous learning. I am excited about
            the prospect of leveraging my current skills while embracing the
            opportunity to learn and apply advanced coding languages to
            contribute innovative solutions to projects.
