## How It Was Created

This website was hand-coded starting from basic HTML5 boilerplate files, enhanced with Bootstrap CSS framework to quickly build a consistent layout. Custom CSS was added to refine colors, typography, and spacing for a professional look. Each page contains semantic HTML sections for SEO and accessibility best practices. The project is modular with separate pages for better scalability and maintenance.
